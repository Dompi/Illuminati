# Microservices

 It is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

    - Highly maintainable and testable
    - Loosely coupled
    - Independently deployable
    - Organized around business capabilities
    - Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
 Some of the important features include:

    - This contains small individual modules for each service.
    - Each service will be implementing a use-case.
    - As these are independent, they will be very small and loosely coupled.
    - Beauty of microservices is that each of the services can be having different codebases.
    - As these services are independent, they can be independent built and deploy.
    - So, if there are any changes needed to be done in any service, We can deploy only that service build unlike the entire build in a monolithic architecture.
    - Because of these flexibilities, we can develop and deploy services independent to each other.
    - Developers need not have a complete picture of the entire project.
    - They can only concentrate on the service they are working, which is very flexible to new employees.
    - Maintaining several small teams for different services are flexible.
